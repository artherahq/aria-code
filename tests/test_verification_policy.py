"""The agent must be able to check its own work under the default policy.

`safe` blocked pytest, py_compile, npm test and tsc --noEmit, so the loop could
write a fix and then had no way to learn whether it worked. Seen verbatim from
a real Gemini run: "由于安全策略的限制，我无法执行 pytest ... 但我相信测试应该
能够通过". An agent that cannot verify is guessing, and the acceptance gate is
built entirely on running these commands.
