"""quant_engine — vendored commodity quant modules (sports + stochastic).

Elo/Dixon-Coles football prediction and Black-Scholes/Monte-Carlo/Kelly
options+derivatives math. Proprietary factor/ML/strategy engines stay in the
private Arthera platform.

Open-core boundary: callers MUST go through ``is_available()`` and degrade
gracefully when it returns False. Today the source is bundled, so it is always
available — but routing every use through this boundary means the day the engine
is split into a separate compiled (.so) wheel, the free shell keeps working with
no caller changes (see tools/build_quant_engine.py, CLOSING_SOURCE.md).
