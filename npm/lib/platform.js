 * Which prebuilt binary this machine needs, and where npm put it.

 * The previous install did none of this: postinstall.js ran 651 lines of
 * bootstrap on every machine — Xcode CLT, Homebrew, a Python toolchain, a git
 * clone of this repository, a venv, then pip. Every one of those is a way for
 * `npm install -g` to fail, and it made the install depend on GitHub, Homebrew
 * and PyPI all being reachable.
 *
 * Claude Code and Codex both solve it the same way, and measurably smaller:
 * a dispatcher package of 0.2 MB and 0.01 MB respectively, zero runtime
 * dependencies, and the per-platform binaries as optionalDependencies so npm
 * downloads exactly the one that matches. This module is the resolution half of
 * that, kept pure so it can be tested without a binary present.

// All five are built by build-native-binaries.yml — macOS on macos-14 and
// macos-15-intel, Linux on ubuntu-latest and ubuntu-24.04-arm, Windows on
// windows-latest. Both references ship these same platforms (Codex six,
// Claude Code eight, the extra two being musl variants), and every runner here
// is GitHub-hosted, so each one is a native build.
//
// Not covered: musl (Alpine). A glibc binary does not run there, which is why
// Claude Code ships linux-x64-musl and linux-arm64-musl separately. Anyone on
// Alpine gets the unsupported message and `pip install aria-code`.
