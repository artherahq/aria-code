"""``publish_artifact`` — the tool that makes the canvas an agent capability.

What was missing
----------------
Every piece of the artifact story already existed: ``artifacts.py`` records
and versions them, ``preview_server.py`` serves them with live SSE updates and
a version stepper, and ``/canvas`` opens the panel.  What did not exist was a
way for the *model* to put something on it.  The agent could only write an HTML
file and hope a human had typed ``/canvas`` and would think to look.

That gap is the whole difference between "the tool can produce files" and "the
assistant makes you a thing you can look at". The mechanic worth copying is not
the renderer — it is that publishing is a **tool call**, so the model decides a
visual answer is the right answer and the artifact simply appears, versioned,
next to the conversation.

What it deliberately does not do
--------------------------------
It does not start the preview server on its own.  ``preview_server`` is opt-in
by design — nothing in it runs until a human types ``/canvas`` — and a tool the
model can call at will is exactly the wrong thing to hang an auto-starting
local HTTP server off.  With no canvas running, publishing still records and
versions the artifact and tells the model where it went, and the human sees it
the moment they open the panel.

Safety
------
Artifact HTML is model-generated and is rendered in a browser, so the server
frames it with ``sandbox="allow-scripts"`` (an opaque origin, no
``allow-same-origin``) under a ``connect-src 'none'`` CSP. This tool adds the
half the server cannot see: it refuses to publish a file from outside the
workspace, so "publish this artifact" can never become a way to read
``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` into a browser tab.
