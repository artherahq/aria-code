"""Which tools a turn is offered — for every provider, not just Ollama.

The gap this closes
-------------------
The pack contract has three contributions: handlers, a prompt fragment, and
*tools*.  Two of them were wired.  ``active_tool_names()`` was written, exported
and never called by anything, so the third was inert: every turn on every
provider was offered every registered tool.

Concretely, a request to fix a failing test reached Gemini carrying all 74 tool
schemas, 34 of them domain tools — market quotes, broker orders, backtests,
Stripe analysis, freight reconciliation.  That is the same shape as the system
prompt only reaching Ollama: a decision the architecture already knew how to
make, not applied on the path that matters most.

Why it matters beyond context size
----------------------------------
Wasted context is the smaller cost.  The real one is that a tool in the list is
a tool the model may call, and the incident the pack contract exists to prevent
— a question about this repository answered with a MongoDB stock quote — is
exactly a domain tool firing on a message that named nothing in its domain.
Leaving all 34 in view on every coding turn keeps that door open.

The rule
--------
A domain tool is offered only when its pack has claimed the message.  Anything
no pack claims is core and always available, which makes the default safe:
adding a tool nobody assigns to a domain keeps working exactly as before, and
the burden is on a domain to say "this one is mine".
