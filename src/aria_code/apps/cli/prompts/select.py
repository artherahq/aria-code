"""Pick the system prompt for a turn, for every provider — not just Ollama.

The gap this closes
-------------------
``CODING_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` — the tool discipline, the orient-before-search rule,
"never say 'I will do X', just do it", the note that verification runs itself —
was built inside ``providers/llm/ollama_stream.py`` and nowhere else.  Every
other backend reached the model with an empty system prompt.

So the strongest model available ran with no instructions at all.  It showed up
exactly as the rules predict when they are missing: given a failing test,
Gemini narrated a five-step plan, read the test file, announced "now I will
read calc.py" — and stopped, having called no tool and changed nothing.  It was
not incapable; it had never been told that describing an edit is not making
one.

Why this module rather than moving the code
-------------------------------------------
``ollama_stream`` builds far more than a base prompt: prefetched market data,
project context sized to the model, injected memory, skill activation.  Moving
all of that would destabilise the path that currently works to fix the one that
does not.  This module owns only the decision every path shares — *which* base
prompt this message calls for — so the two agree on the rules without the cloud
path inheriting Ollama's plumbing.
