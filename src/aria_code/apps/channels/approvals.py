"""Approvals: a bot may propose an action with consequences, a person decides.

Bot runs cannot use confirmation-required tools, because nobody in a chat can
answer a terminal prompt. That stops harm and also stops the useful half of
the job — a reorder list someone still has to retype. This is the other way
through: the bot writes down exactly what it proposes, an authorised person
approves or rejects it in the chat, and only then does it happen, with a
record of who decided what and when.

Platform-neutral like the rest of apps/channels. A channel renders a request
with approve/reject buttons and calls `decide` when one is pressed; the rules
below hold whichever platform the button was on:

  - Who may decide: ARIA_CHANNEL_APPROVERS, plus ARIA_CHANNEL_ADMINS, per
    channel ("feishu:ou_x"). Nobody, when neither is set.
  - Where: only in the conversation the request was raised in. A card
    forwarded to another chat cannot be approved there.
  - Once: the transition out of "pending" is a single conditional UPDATE, so
    two clicks, or two approvers at the same moment, cannot both execute.
  - Not late: a request expires after `ttl_seconds` (24 h).
  - Not for someone else: the conversation must still be bound to the shipper
    the request was made for, and the action runs under ARIA_OWNER_SCOPE.
  - What was approved is what runs: the payload is frozen at request time and
    executed as stored, never recomputed — the approver saw these lines.

Actions are registered in EXECUTORS. The first, "purchase_order_draft", writes
a CSV draft to an outbox directory (ARIA_APPROVAL_OUTBOX) for the 3PL's own
purchasing system to pick up. Aria does not place orders: it has no
integration that could, and pretending otherwise would be the wrong default.
