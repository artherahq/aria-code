"""Payments — Stripe objects.

The cleanest case the pack contract has.  Stripe object ids carry a typed
prefix (``ch_`` charge, ``pi_`` payment intent, ``cus_`` customer, ``sub_``
subscription…) followed by a long opaque suffix, so recognising one is a
resolution rather than a guess: nothing else in an English or Chinese sentence
looks like ``pi_3PqR8s2eZvKYlo2C0aBcDeFg``.

That precision is what lets this pack stay registered permanently at no cost.
It cannot fire on domain vocabulary — the words "payment", "refund" and
"订阅" never activate it — so a payments deployment adds nothing to the latency
or the failure surface of a session about anything else.
