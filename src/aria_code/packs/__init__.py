"""Domain packs — subject areas that plug into a domain-neutral core.

The core knows about code, documents, data, and conversation.  Everything that
belongs to a subject area — the identifiers it uses, the tools that act on
them, the guidance a model needs to reason about them — lives in a pack and is
switched on only when the user's message names something that pack recognises.

Adding a domain means adding a pack.  It does not mean adding a branch to a
router, an intent label to the classifier, or a handler to a chain that every
message walks.

See ``aria_code.packs.base`` for the contract and ``aria_code.packs.registry``
for the activation rule.
