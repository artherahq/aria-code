"""Real estate — a city's housing market.

This pack is the contract's hard case, and worth reading as one.  Its domain
has no ``AAPL`` and no ``ch_3Pq…``: the thing a housing question is *about* is
a city, and a city name on its own is a perfectly ordinary word.  "北京" appears
in travel plans, in address parsing, in a comment about a datacenter region.

So the entity this pack resolves is not the city.  It is **this city's housing
market**, which takes two parts to name: a city from a real table, and a
housing term in the same message.  A city alone resolves at a confidence below
the activation threshold — reported, so the UI can ask, but never enough to
answer a code question with a house-price index on its own initiative.

That is the same rule finance applies to a bare uppercase run, arrived at from
the opposite direction: finance has to *demote* a shape that looks like an
identifier, and realty has to *combine* two things neither of which is one.
